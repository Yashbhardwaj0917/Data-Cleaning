# Data Cleaning: Working with Column Names

This project demonstrates various data cleaning techniques related to working with column names in a dataset. Properly managing and manipulating column names is crucial for effective data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning tasks. In this notebook, we cover the following topics:

1. **Checking Columns:** Understanding how to access, view, and manipulate column names in a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Renaming Columns:** Demonstrating how to rename columns to make them more descriptive or standardized.

3. **Replacing Characters:** Techniques for replacing specific characters or spaces in column names.

4. **Converting Case:** Converting column names to uppercase, lowercase, or title case for consistency.

5. **Selecting Columns:** Methods for selecting specific columns based on criteria or excluding particular columns.

6. **Selecting Groups:** Selecting columns that share a common characteristic, such as a phrase or prefix.

## Usage

To replicate and customize these data cleaning techniques for your own dataset:

1. Make sure you have Python and the Pandas library installed on your system.

2. Download or import your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Update the dataset loading code accordingly in your Python environment.

3. Copy and paste the provided Python code snippets into your preferred Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or a code editor.

4. Execute the code snippets step by step to perform each data cleaning operation. Customize the code as needed to match your dataset's column names and requirements.

5. Document any changes made to column names in your README file to maintain clarity and transparency.
