# Data Cleaning Using Python: Practical Examples

Welcome to this practical data cleaning project in Python! This project demonstrates various data cleaning techniques, with a particular focus on working with string data using the Pandas library. We cover a wide range of tasks to enhance your data cleaning skills:

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore real-world data cleaning scenarios, including:

1. **Column Consistency**: Ensuring consistency in column names for easy reference.

2. **Renaming Columns**: Renaming columns to make them more informative and standardized.

3. **Splitting Columns**: Splitting a single column into multiple columns based on a delimiter.

4. **Finding and Replacing Strings**: Discovering methods to find and replace specific strings or patterns within columns.

5. **Searching for Strings and Expressions**: Exploring techniques for searching and filtering data based on strings and regular expressions.

6. **Joining Two Columns**: Combining information from two columns into a new one.

7. **Counting Strings in a Column**: Understanding different ways to count the number of strings or words in a column.

## Usage

To replicate and customize these data cleaning techniques for your own dataset:

1. Ensure you have Python and the Pandas library installed on your system.

2. Download or import your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Update the dataset loading code in your Python environment.

3. Copy and paste the provided Python code snippets into your preferred Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or a code editor.

4. Execute the code snippets step by step to perform each data cleaning operation. Customize the code to match your dataset's column names and requirements.

5. Document any changes made to column names or data cleaning steps in your README file to maintain clarity and transparency.
